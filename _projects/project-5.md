Diffusion Models have found a lot of use in a variety of settings. [Grad-TTS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06337.pdf) applies Diffusion Models to the gradual molding of noise into speech. I decided to go ahead and create my unofficial implementation of Grad-TTS for fun. It is available [publicly](https://github.com/testzer0/GradTTS-unoffical).
